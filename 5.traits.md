# 5. Traits

Implementations of the specification SHOULD provide the traits system for attaching operational behaviors to instances of components. However, the specification does not define which traits must be provided.

A _trait_ is a discretionary runtime overlay that augments the workload type (`workloadType`) with additional features. It is an opportunity for those in the _application operator_ role to make specific decisions about the configuration of components, but without involving the developer.

An individual trait MAY be tied to specific workload types (or MAY apply to all workload types). A trait MAY declare which workload types it applies to. For example, an _autoscaler_ trait could apply to a workload type _replicable service_, but not to type _singleton_. The `autoscaler` trait itself MUST define that restriction if present.

There is no mechanism for explicitly requiring a combination of traits. For example, a trait (`ssl`) cannot require that another trait (`ingress`) be applied to an object. However, _implementations_ of a trait SHOULD fail if one trait cannot fulfill its contract without the presence of another trait. A system MAY support a mechanism in which a trait (`sslIngress`) is opaquely backed by two separate trait implementations (`ssl` and `ingress`).

Because components can specify multiple traits, an implementation MUST support the application of zero or more traits to a component. An implementation MUST produce an error and stop deployment if the requested traits cannot be fulfilled by the underlying runtime.

The specification does not set requirements about how simple or complicated a trait may be. Some might expose an expansive set of configurable options while others may expose no configurable options. And it is not required that a trait be as exhaustive as its underlying technology. For example, an implementation of an autoscaling technology may provide numerous ways of determining when a component should scale. But the trait may only surface a few of those. Likewise, multiple autoscaling traits may be defined (each uniquely named), where each trait exposes a different subset of configurable options. Or one large trait may expose all of the possible autoscaling configurations.

### Defining a Trait

This section is normative because traits are an inspectable (and possibly shareable) part of the system. All traits MUST be representable in the following format.

Traits are defined with schematics like components.

#### Top-Level Attributes

The top-level attributes of a trait define its metadata, version, kind, and spec.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `apiVersion` | `string` | Y || The specific version of the specification in use. At present only `core.hydra.io/v1alpha1` is defined. |
| `kind` | `string` | Y || The string `Trait` |
| `metadata` | `[]Metadata(#metadata)` | Y | | Trait metadata. |
| `spec`| [`Spec`](#spec) | Y || A container for exposing trait attributes. |

#### Metadata

Metadata describes this trait.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Y | | The name of the trait |
| `version` | `string` | Y | | The version of the trait |
| `description` | `string` | Y | | A short description of the trait. |
| `labels` | `map[string]string` | N | | A set of string key/value pairs used as arbitrary labels on this component. | 


#### Spec

The specification defines two major things: The list of workload types to which this trait applies, and the list of configurable parameters on this trait.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `appliesTo` | `[]string` | N | `["*"]` | The list of workload types that this trait applies to. `"*"` means _any workload type_ |
| `parameters` | [`[]Parameter`](#parameter) | N | | The component's configuration options. |

#### Parameter

The parameters that this trait exposes to operators.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Y | | The parameter's name. Must be unique per trait. |
| `description` | `string` | N | | A description of the parameter. |
| `type` | `string` | Y | | The parameter's type (One of `string`, `boolean`, `number`). |
| `required` | `boolean` | N |`false` | Whether a value _must_ be provided for the parameter. |
| `default` | type indicated by `type` field | N | | The parameter's default value. |

#### Example: Manual Scaler

This is an example of a trait definition that manually scales replicable services or replicable tasks:

```yaml
apiVersion: extentsion.hydra.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
    name: manualscaler
    version: v1.0.0
    description: Allow operator to manually scale a service
spec:
    appliesTo:
        - replicableService
        - replicableTask
    parameters:
        - name: replicaCount
          description: The number of replicas desired for this component instance
          type: int
          required: true
```

The example above illustrates a trait used to manually scale a service. This trait has only one parameter: `replicaCount`. This takes an integer, and a value is required for this trait to be successfully applied. If, for example, an operational configuration used this trait but did not provide the `replicaCount`, the system would reject the operational configuration.

#### Example: Autoscaler

This is an example trait definition that applies an autoscaler to scalable workload types.

```yaml
apiVersion: core.hydra.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
    name: autoscaler
    version: v1.0.0
    description: Provide autoscaler support
spec:
    appliesTo:
        - replicableService
        - replicableTask
    parameters:
        - name: maxReplicas
          description: An upper bound on the maximum number of replicas to create
          type: int
          default: 100
        - name: minReplicas
          description: Minimum number of replicas to maintain
          type: int
          default: 2
        - name: scalingPolicy
          description: The policy used for determining when to scale
          type: string
          default: CPUUsage
```

The example above defines a trait named `autoscaler` that applies to either `replicableService` or `replicableTask` and defines three parameters: `maxReplicas`, `minReplicas`, and `scalingPolicy`. Note that there is no reference to what is responsible for actualizing this trait. Traits do not expose their implementations.

### Runtime Considerations for Traits

The implementation of a trait is beyond the scope of this document. But any trait that is made available in a runtime MUST be implemented for that runtime. (That is, there cannot be a trait for `autoscaling`, but no implementation of that trait).

Traits should be applied into the runtime at installation/upgrade time. Traits should not be checked "lazily", but should be checked when the trait-holding components are created.

When more than one trait is attached to a component, it MUST:

- Apply the traits in the defined order
- Determine compatibility, and fail if the combination of traits cannot be satisfied

Traits are applied in order so that should some set of traits express dependency (e.g. ingress must be set up before SSL), this can be resolved by setting an explicit ordering.

> For any given trait, only _one instance_ of that trait can be applied to a component.

A deployment SHOULD NOT be marked complete until all trait configurations are completed. For example, if a web server component is deployed with an autoscaler, the web server should not be considered "running" until (a) the web server itself is running, as determined by health checks, and (b) the autoscaler is running, as determined by the underlying platform.

### Examples Traits

This section is non-normative. It gives examples of what sorts of things a trait may represent.

#### Manual Scaler

Some types declare that they can be replicated (like `replicableService` and `replicableTask`). Different approaches may be used in determining how to scale a service. For example, an `autoscaler` may be applied (see below). Or traits may provide ways for operators to manually set additional configuration, as is the case with a `manualScaler`.

#### Autoscaling

The developer has delivered a component of type "replicated service". Operations determines that this particular component can easily be scaled automatically. So the trait `autoscaler` is applied to the component, and the app ops team applies configuration for thresholds.

In Kubernetes, for example, an autoscaler trait may be handled by a HorizontalPodAutoscaler (or some other custom autoscaler). In advanced cases, the metrics or other data from a component could be used as input into an autoscaler.

#### SSL

Developers have delivered HTTP servers. The operations team, charged with applying SSL to all services and then managing the x509 certificates, apply an `ssl` trait, which provides an SSL endpoint for this component. The operations team then manages the certificates.

```yaml
apiVersion: core.hydra.io/v1alpha1
kind: Trait
metadata:
  name: SSL      # The name of the trait
spec:
  # Which primitives can use this trait.
  appliesTo: [ ReplicatedService, SingletonService ]     
  parameters:      # The parameters that a trait user may supply
    - name: ca
      type: string
      description: The certificate authority
    - name: certificate
      type: string
      description: The x509 certificate
    - name: privateKey
       type: string
       description: The private key for the certificate
```

A possible implementation of this trait would set up a proxy sidecar that acted as an SSL proxy, handling TLS negotiation, and passing the plain HTTP request on to the base component. In this case, the component knows nothing at all about SSL configuration. It is handled entirely by the platform.

#### AB Testing

The operations team would like to run two copies of the same website -- each running a slightly divergent version of the software. To accomplish this, both components are given the `testAB` trait, and are configured to split load.

This example shows how a trait may define parameters that the implementation may use for grouping:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.hydra.io/v1alpha1
kind: Trait
metadata:
    name: abTesting
    version: v1.0.0
    description: Provide A/B testing
spec:
    appliesTo:
        - replicatedService
    parameters:
        - name: testingGroup
          type: string
          description: The name of the testing group to which this component belongs. Load is split among all members of this group. 
        - name: weight
          type: string
          description: >
            The relative weighting attached to this component. All weights for the group will be totaled and converted to a percentage,
            and traffic will be split accordingly
```

A potential implementation of this would watch for multiple components that subscribe to the same A/B group. This service would then insert a proxy between them, and that proxy would shape traffic according to the weights given.

#### Ingress

The operations team would like to declare that this component is accessible from another network.

A potential implementation of this may respond to an ingress trait by creating a new mapping on a proxy, load balancer, or ingress controller that routes traffic into the cluster. Here is an example configuration that declares a mapping of a component to a domain name for the ingress:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.hydra.io/v1alpha1
kind: OperationalConfiguration
metadata:
    name: custom-single-app
    description: Customized version of single-app
spec:
  components:
    - componentName: frontend
      instanceName: web-front-end
      traits:
        - name: app-ingress
          type: core.hydra.io/v1alpha1.Ingress
          properties:
            - name: host
              value: www.example.com
            - name: path
              value: "/"
```

The ingress would then map request for `www.example.com` to the `simple-app` component's `/` path.

#### DNS Name

The operations team would like to assign this component a particular DNS name. The operator can then apply a rule to match the name to a given address. A trait such as this may behave differently depending on whether the DNS is attached to a public IP (via an `ingress`, perhaps) or to an internal IP. By design, these relationships are to be expressed using parameters.

An implementation of this may take a DNS name from configuration and seek to set a record in a DNS-as-a-service offering.
