# 3. The Component Model

## Component Schematics

The role of a component schematic is to permit developers to declare the
operational characteristics of a discrete unit execution in infrastructure
neutral terms.

## Units for Time, CPU, Memory, and Disk

In places in this specification, certain units of measure are applied. This section describes those units of measure.

### Timing (Intervals)

For timing, the default unit of time is seconds, represented as an integer.

### CPU count

CPU count is represented as a floating point number, where `1` means one CPU, `2` means 2 CPUs, and `0.5` means half of a CPU.

The exact meaning of this unit varies from platform to platform.  Implementors should consider that logical cpu is equivalent to one AWS vCPU or one Azure vCore or one GCP Core or one IBM vCPU. Fractional values are allowed. If a runtime does not support fractional units, it MUST round up (ceiling function) to the next integer value.

### Memory and Disk

Memory and disk space use the notation for bytes/kilo/mega/giga/tera/peta by just using the major unit:

- `1024` is 1024 bytes
- `88K` is 88 kilobytes
- `5M` is 5 megabytes
- `7G` is 7 gigabytes
- `100T` is 100 terabytes
- `9999P` is 9999 petabytes

If a `B` is appended, it MUST be ignored. Thus, `5M` and `5MB` are treated as identical. Case is unimportant. `15k` and `15K` MUST be treated as the same value.

### Representation

All component schematics are canonically represented as JSON and can be validated using the provided JSON Schema. Because it is more amenable for human consumption, YAML is also supported, and most of the examples are given in YAML. For the sake of validation, YAML may be converted to an equivalent JSON representation before validating it against the JSON Schema.

### Top-Level Attributes

The following attributes are common across all schemata defined in this document. This structure is designed to allow object type to be determined by scanning two fields (`apiVersion` and `kind`), and provide access to common fields in the `metadata` section. The `spec` section is where type-specific information is located, and in this section the `spec` section defines a `Component`.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `apiVersion` | `string` | Y || The specific version of the Hydra specification in use. This version of the specification covers apiVersions in `core.hydra.io/v1alpha1`. |
| `kind` | `string` | Y || For a component schematic, must be `ComponentSchematic`. |
| `metadata` | `Metadata(#metadata)` | Y | | Component metadata. |
| `spec`| [`Spec`](#spec) | Y || A container for all remaining attributes. |

### Metadata

Metadata provides information about the contents of this object.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Y | | | A unique name for the component. |
| `description` | `string` | Y | | A short description of the component. |
| `version` | `string` | Y | | A string defining the [semantic version](https://semver.org/) of the component. |
| `labels` | `map[string]string` | N | | A set of string key/value pairs used as arbitrary labels on this component. | 

### Spec

The spec defines the constituent parts of a component.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `parameters` | [`[]Parameter`](#parameter) | N | | The component's configuration options. |
| `workloadType` | `string` | Y | | A succinct, semantically meaningful descriptor of the component's runtime profile. See ["Workload Types"](#workload-types). |
| `osType` | `string` | N | `linux` | The OS required to host (all of) the component's containers (since containers share a kernel with the underlying host). Possible values include:<ul><li>linux</li><li>windows</li></ul> For extended runtimes, this is passed in unaltered. |
| `arch` | `string` | N | `amd64` | The CPU architecture required to host (all of) the component's containers (since containers share physical hardware with the underlying host). Possible values include:<ul><li>i386</li><li>amd64</li><li>arm</li><li>arm64</li></ul> |
| `containers` | [`[]Container`](#container) | N | | The OCI container(s) that implement the component. |
| `workloadSettings` | `[]WorkloadSettting` | N | | Declaration of non-container settings that should be passed to the workload runtime|

### Parameter

The Parameters section defines all of the configurable parameters for this component.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Y | | The parameter's name. Must be unique per component. |
| `description` | `string` | N | | A description of the parameter. |
| `type` | `string` | Y | | The parameter's type. One of `boolean`, `number`, `string`, or `null` as defined in [the JSON specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159) and the [JSON Schema Validation spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-handrews-json-schema-validation-01#section-6) |
| `required` | `boolean` | N |`false` | Whether a value _must_ be provided for the parameter. |
| `default` | type indicated by `type` field | N | | The parameter's default value. |

### Workload Types

A _workload type_ is an indicator to the runtime as to how it should execute the given workload. In other words, it provides a single field by which the developer can indicate to the runtime how the developer intends for this component to be executed.

Workloads are named using a simple convention: `GROUP/VERSION.KIND`, where `GROUP` is a uniquely named service collection, `VERSION` is an API version, and `KIND` is a group-unique name of a service.

Examples:

- `core.hydra.io/v1alpha1.Singleton`: The group is `core.hydra`, meaning it is built-in. The version indicates that this is still an alpha version (`v1alpha1`). The kind is `Singleton`. This means the core singleton runtime must be used for this component.
- `azure.com/v1.Function`: The group is `azure.com` (which is a vendor-specific implementation, and may not be present on all runtimes). The version is `v1`, which marks this as stable. The kind is `Function`, whose runtime implementation is the Azure Functions offering.
- `streams.hydra.io/v1beta2.Kafka`: The group is `streams.hydra.io`, a hypothetical location where certain vendor-neutral extensions may exist. Version is `v1beta2`, indicating that it is moving toward stability. And the kind is `Kafka`.
- `caching.hydra.io/v2.Redis`: The group is `caching.hydra.io`, version is `v2`, and the kind is `Redis`. This describes an implementation of a Redis cache.

> Group, Version, Kind is a [convention in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/)

There are two kinds of workload types:

- Core workload types
- Extended workload types

#### Core Workload Types

The core workload types MUST be in the `core.hydra.io` group.

The core workload types MUST all be supported by any implementation of the platform. They may be implemented using, for example, cloud primitives, Kubernetes, Service Fabric, or other orchestrators, but they MUST be implemented.

All core workload types are container-based, and assume that an implementation is capable of executing an OCI or Docker image as a container, and are capable of working with OCI registries.

The following core workload types are defined by this specification:

> **Note:** This is a draft. We need to compose a final list before the spec reaches 1.0

- Singleton Service (`core.hydra.io/v1alpha1.Singleton`): This defines a container runtime where only one instance of that container can be run. A singleton provides a long running server that cannot be replicated.
- Replicable Service (`core.hydra.io/v1alpha1.ReplicableService`): This defines a container runtime where zero or more instances of the same container may be run at a time. It can be scaled up or down, depending on the needs of the application. A replicable service provides a long running process.
- Task (`core.hydra.io/v1alpha1.Task`): This defines a non-daemonized non-replicable container instance that will exit when it has completed its workload.
- ReplicableTask (`core.hydra.io/v1alpha1.ReplicableTask`): This defines a non-daemonized replicable container instance that will exit when it has completed its workload. Some scaling techniques may be applied to this, but they are likely different scaling techniques than those assigned to ReplicableServices.

Built-in workload types are focused on two distinguishing points:

1. Whether they are replicable. For non-replicable types, no replication or scaling traits may be assigned.
2. Whether they are daemonized. For daemon types, if the workload exits, this is considered a fault, and the system must fix it. For non-daemonized types, exit is considered a success if no error is reported.

Core workload descriptions MUST include a `container` section in the component schematic. Implementations of the core workload types MUST NOT require that a `workloadSetting` list be present in the component description (though it may allow that some settings are passed that way only if their default values are sufficient for running a workload).

#### Extended Workload Types

Extended workload types are _per runtime_, meaning that each runtime may define its own extended workload types beyond this specification. In the present version of the spec, allowing user-defined extended workload types is _not supported_.

Some workload types are specific to containers, a primary runtime target for the model. Other workload types may allow (or even require) non-component runtimes. For example, a workload type of `azure.com/v1.ContainerInstance` may _require_ that the containerized workload be run using the Azure Container Instances tool, while `azure.com/v1.Functions` may require that a particular non-containerized workload be executed using Azure Functions.

The definition of _workloads_ that is assumed herein is inclusive: It allows hosted services to be considered workloads, along with containerized binaries or VMs. For that reason, it is possible (though not at all required) to model things such as caches, databases, event hubs, functions, and message queues as workloads. This table provides a non-normative example of how extended Hydra services like the last two might have multiple implementations:

3rd-party software | possible workload type | Azure managed service backing 
--|--|--
Kafka            | streams.Kafka                 | EventHubs 
Cassandra        | data.hydra.io/v1.Cassandra    | CosmosDB
MongoDB          | data.hydra.io/v1.MongoDB      | CosmosDB
PostgreSQL       | data.hydra.io/v1.PostgreSQL   | Azure Databases for PostgreSQL
MySQL            | data.hydra.io/v1.MySQL        | Azure Databases for MySQL
MariaDB          | data.hydra.io/v1.MariaDB      | Azure Databases for MariaDB
SQL              | data.hydra.io/v1.SQL          | Azure SQL DB
Apache Gremlin   | graph.hydra.io/v1.Gremlin     | CosmosDB
Apache TinkerPop | graph.hydra.io/v1.TinkerPop   | CosmosDB
AMQP             | messaging.hydra.io/v1.AMQP    | ServiceBus (RabbitMQ in Kubernetes)
SignalR          | messaging.hydra.io/v1.SignalR | Azure SignalR Service
Redis            | caching.hydra.io/v1.Redis     | Azure Redis

([Source](https://github.com/microsoft/hydra-spec/pull/123#issuecomment-491108730))

Extended workload types MAY use the `containers` section of the component schematic, or MAY omit it. Extended workload types MAY use or omit the `workloadSettings` list in the component schematic. The purpose of the `workloadSetting` list is to provide authors of extended workload types with a location for specifying the configuration of that types.

### Container

This section describes the runtime configuration necessary to run a containerized workload for this component.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Y | | The container's name. Must be unique per component. |
| `image` | `string` | Y | | A path-like or URI-like representation of the location of an OCI image. Where applicable, this MAY be prefixed with a registry address, SHOULD be suffixed with a tag, and MUST be suffixed with a digest in [OCI format](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/descriptor.md#digests). The digest may be used to compute the integrity of the image. Valid examples:<ul><li>`krancour/foobar@sha256:72e996751fe42b2a0c1e6355730dc2751ccda50564fec929f76804a6365ef5ef`</li><li> `krancour/foobar:v1.0.0@sha256:72e996751fe42b2a0c1e6355730dc2751ccda50564fec929f76804a6365ef5ef`</li><li>`krancour.azurecr.io/foobar@sha256:72e996751fe42b2a0c1e6355730dc2751ccda50564fec929f76804a6365ef5ef`</li><li>`krancour.azurecr.io/foobar/v1.0.0@sha256:72e996751fe42b2a0c1e6355730dc2751ccda50564fec929f76804a6365ef5ef`</li></ul> |
| `resources` | [`Resources`](#resources) | Y | | Resources required by the container. |
| `env` | [`[]Env`](#env) | N | | Environment variables for the container. |
| `ports` | [`[]Port`](#port) | N | | Ports exposed by the container. |
| `livenessProbe` | [`HealthProbe`](#healthprobe) | N | | Instructions for assessing whether the container is alive. |
| `readinessProbe` | [`HealthProbe`](#healthprobe) | N | | Instructions for assessing whether the container is in a suitable state to serve traffic. |


### WorkloadSetting

This section describes additional configuration for a workload (settings that are not about a container runtime).

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Y | | The name of this workload setting |
| `type` | `string` | N | `string` | The data type passed into the value. This is used as a hint to the underlying implementation |
| `value` | any | N || The value for this workload setting, if `fromParam` is not present |
| `fromParam` | string | N || The name of the parameter from whence to fetch the setting value. Overrides `value` |

The `workloadSettings` section of a component schematic is an extensible location for specifying workload-specific configuration. Its primary purpose is to hold definitions for _non-containerized extended workload types_, though it may be used for containerized workload types where applicable.

> The available settings are listed on the workload type object. See [section 7](7.workload_types.md) for details.

Workload settings are passed as name/value pairs, where the type of value may be anything supported by JSON/YAML. The runtime environment MAY choose to treat `workloadSettings` values as opaque, merely passing them directly to an implementing service. A runtime MAY return an error if certain constraints are not met, including:

- Missing an expected name/value pair
- An unrecognized key/value pair
- A malformed value
- An incompatibility based on the provided name/value pairs

### Resources

Resources describe compute resources attached to a runtime.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `cpu` | [`CPU`](#cpu) | Y |  | Specifies the attributes of the cpu resource required for the container. |
| `memory` | [`Memory`](#memory) | Y | | Specifies the attributes of the memory resource required for the container. |
| `gpu` | [`GPU`](#gpu) | N |  | Specifies the attributes of the gpu resources required for the container. |
| `volumes` | [`[]Volume`](#volume) | N | | Specifies the attributes of the volumes that the container uses. |

For any resource that cannot be satisfied by the underlying platform, the platform MUST return an error and cease deployment. A resource is considered a requirement, and failure to meet that requirement means the runtime MUST NOT deploy the application. For example, if an application requests `1P` of memory, and that amount of memory is not available, the application deployment must fail. Likewise, if an application requires `1` gpu, and the runtime does not provide gpus, the application deployment MUST fail.

### CPU

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `required` | `double` | Y |  | The minimum number of logical cpus required for running this container. |

See the Units section above for valid values.

#### Memory

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `required` | `string` | Y | | The minimum amount of memory in MB required  for running this container. The value should be a positive integer, greater than zero. |

See the Units section above for valid values.

#### GPU

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `required` | `double` | Y |  | The minimum number of gpus  required for running this container. |

See the Units section above for valid values.

#### Volume

Volume describes name, a location to mount the volume, along with access mode (such as read/write or read-only) and sharing policy for the mount. It also describes the underneath disk attributes needed by the volume.
The format of the path is specific to the operating system of the consuming service, though implementations SHOULD provide support for UNIX-like path representations.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Y |  | Specifies the name used to reference the path. |
| `mountPath` | `string` | Y |  | Specifies the actual mount path in the filesystem. |
| `accessMode` | `string` | N | `RW` | Specifies the access mode. Allowed values are `RW` (read/write) and `RO` (read-only). |
| `sharingPolicy` | `string` | N | `Exclusive` | The sharing policy for the mount, indicating if it is expected to be shared or not. Allowed values are `Exclusive` and `Shared`. |
| `disk` | [`Disk`](#disk) | N |  | Specifies the attributes of the underneath disk resources required by the volume. |

See the Units section above for valid values.

#### Disk

The disk specifies the attributes of the disk used by the volume. It describes information such as minimum disk size and the disk is ephemeral or not. Ephemeral disk indicates the component requires minimum disk size on the node to run it. For example, image processing component may require a larger cache on the node to run could use ephemeral disk. When ephemeral disk is set to false, it indicates external disk will be used.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `required` | `string` | Y |  | The minimum disk size required for running this container. The value should be a positive integer, greater than zero. |
| `ephemeral` | `boolean` | N | | Specifies whether external disk needs to be mounted or not. |

See the Units section above for valid values.

### Env

Env describes an environment variable as a name/value pair of strings.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Y || The environment variable name. Must be unique per container. |
| `value` | `string` | N || The environment variable value. If this is not supplied, `fromParam` must be supplied |
| `fromParam` | `string` | N || The parameter whose value should be substituted into this variable as a value |

Example:

```yaml
env:
  - name: "ADMIN_USER"
    value: "admin"  # This is a literal value
  - name: "LOGO_URL"
    fromParam: "logoURL" # This will cause the value to be read from the parameter whose name is `logoURL`
```

If both `fromParam` and `value` are specified, `fromParam` MUST take precedence, even if the parameter value is an empty value. If neither is specified, the runtime MUST produce an error.

### Port

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Y || A descriptive name for the port. Must be unique per container. |
| `containerPort` | `integer` | Y || The port number. Must be unique per container. |
| `protocol` | `string` | N | `TCP` | Indicates the transport layer protocol used by the server listening on the port. Valid values are `TCP` and `UDP`. |

### HealthProbe

Health Probe describes how a probing operation is to be executed as a way of determining the health of a component.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `exec` | [`Exec`](#exec) | N || Instructions for assessing container health by executing a command. Either this attribute or the `httpGet` attribute or the `tcpSocket` attribute MUST be specified. This attribute is mutually exclusive with both the `httpGet` attribute and the `tcpSocket` attribute. |
| `httpGet` | [`HTTPGet`](#httpget) | N || Instructions for assessing container health by executing an HTTP GET request. Either this attribute or the `exec` attribute or the `tcpSocket` attribute MUST be specified. This attribute is mutually exclusive with both the `exec` attribute and the `tcpSocket` attribute. |
| `tcpSocket` | [`TCPSocket`](#tcpsocket) | N || Instructions for assessing container health by probing a TCP socket. Either this attribute or the `exec` attribute or the `httpGet` attribute MUST be specified. This attribute is mutually exclusive with both the `exec` attribute and the `httpGet` attribute. |
| `initialDelaySeconds` | `integer` | N | `0` | Number of seconds after the container is started before the first probe is initiated. |
| `periodSeconds` | `integer` | N | `10` | How often, in seconds, to execute the probe. |
| `timeoutSeconds` | `integer` | N | `1` | Number of seconds after which the probe times out. |
| `successThreshold` | `integer` | N | `1` | Minimum consecutive successes for the probe to be considered successful after having failed. |
| `failureThreshold` | `integer` | N | `3` | Number of consecutive failures required to determine the container is not alive (liveness probe) or not ready (readiness probe). |

See the Units section above for valid time values.

### Exec

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `command` | `[]string` | Y || A command to be executed inside the container to assess its health. Each space delimited token of the command is a separate array element. Commands exiting `0` are considered to be successful probes, whilst all other exit codes are considered failures. |

|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `path` | `string` | Y || The endpoint, relative to the `port`, to which the HTTP GET request should be directed. |
| `port` | `integer` | Y || The TCP socket within the container to which the HTTP GET request should be directed. |
| `httpHeaders` | [`[]HTTPHeader`](#httpheader) | N || Optional HTTP headers. |

### HTTPHeader

|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Y || An HTTP header name. This must be unique per HTTP GET-based probe. |
| `value` | `string` | Y || An HTTP header value. |

### TCPSocket

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `port` | `integer` | Y || The TCP socket within the container that should be probed to assess container health. |

### Examples

This section illustrates use of the component schematic schema defined above to
describe two discrete components of a Twitter bot application.

Our first component is a frontend administrative interface. End users (bot
admins) authenticate using basic authentication. The interface permits end users
to configure what kind of content the bot will tweet and the intervals at which
it will do so.

Because this component is stateless and horizontally scalable, it is described
as a `ReplicableService`. The username, password, and address of the backend
component are configurable.

```yaml
apiVersion: core.hydra.io/v1alpha1
kind: ComponentSchematic

    resources:
      cpu:
        required: 1.0
      memory:

      value: 8080
    env:
    - name: USERNAME
      fromParam: 'username'
    - name: PASSWORD
      fromParam: 'password'
    - name: BACKEND_ADDRESS
      fromParam: 'backend-address'
    livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        port: 8080
        path: /healthz
    readinessProbe:
      httpGet:
        port: 8080
        path: /healthz
```

Our second component implements both the backend for our Twitter bot's
administrative interface and a background worker process that will Tweet
end-user-defined content at end-user-defined intervals (defined through the
administrative interface). This component also persists its end-user-defined
configuration to disk as a JSON file.

This component's design prevents it from scaling horizontally, so we should only
have at most _one_ instance of it running. As such, this component is described
as a `Singleton`. Connection details for the Twitter API are
configurable. The component schematic also describes the file system location
where the component persists end-user-defined configuration.

#### Example: Extended Workload Type

Imagine a service runtime that checks out code from a Git repository and executes it as an Azure function. This service might be used as follows:

```yaml

kind: ComponentSchematic
metadata:
  description: Extended workflow example
spec:
  workloadType: azure.com/v1.Function
  parameters:
  - name: github-token
    description: GitHub API session key
    type: string
    required: true
  workloadSettings:
    - name: source
      value: git://git.example.com/function/myfunction.git
    - name: github_token
      fromParam: github-token
