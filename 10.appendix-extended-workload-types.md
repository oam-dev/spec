# Appendix A: Extended Workload Types

*This section is non-normative.* An implementation of the Hydra specification may be deemed compliant without implementing this portion of the specification.

This section provides guidance on the naming of extended workload types.

Some workload types are specific to containers, a primary runtime target for the model. Other workload types may allow (or even require) non-component runtimes. For example, a workload type of `azure.com/v1.ContainerInstance` may _require_ that the containerized workload be run using the Azure Container Instances tool, while `azure.com/v1.Functions` may require that a particular non-containerized workload be executed using Azure Functions.

The definition of _workloads_ that is assumed herein is inclusive: It allows hosted services to be considered workloads, along with containerized binaries or VMs. For that reason, it is possible (though not at all required) to model things such as caches, databases, event hubs, functions, and message queues as workloads. This table provides a non-normative example of how extended Hydra services like the last two might have multiple implementations:

3rd-party software | possible workload type | Azure managed service backing 
--|--|--
Kafka            | streams.Kafka                 | EventHubs 
Cassandra        | data.hydra.io/v1.Cassandra    | CosmosDB
MongoDB          | data.hydra.io/v1.MongoDB      | CosmosDB
PostgreSQL       | data.hydra.io/v1.PostgreSQL   | Azure Databases for PostgreSQL
MySQL            | data.hydra.io/v1.MySQL        | Azure Databases for MySQL
MariaDB          | data.hydra.io/v1.MariaDB      | Azure Databases for MariaDB
SQL              | data.hydra.io/v1.SQL          | Azure SQL DB
Apache Gremlin   | graph.hydra.io/v1.Gremlin     | CosmosDB
Apache TinkerPop | graph.hydra.io/v1.TinkerPop   | CosmosDB
AMQP             | messaging.hydra.io/v1.AMQP    | ServiceBus (RabbitMQ in Kubernetes)
SignalR          | messaging.hydra.io/v1.SignalR | Azure SignalR Service
Redis            | caching.hydra.io/v1.Redis     | Azure Redis
