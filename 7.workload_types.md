# 7. Workload Types

Using `workloadType` is covered in section [3. Component Model](3.component_model.md), but workload type definitions are described here.

Workload types are provided by the platform (just as traits are) so that users may inspect the platform and learn what workload types are available for use. Workload types are not extensible to platform users (only to platform operators). Thus, platform users MUST NOT be allowed to create new workload types.

#### Top-Level Attributes

These attributes provide top-level information about the workload type.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `apiVersion` | `string` | Y || The specific version of the specification in use. The core types use `core.oam.dev/v1alpha1` |
| `kind` | `string` | Y || The string `WorkloadType` |
| `metadata` | [`Metadata`](#metadata) | Y | | WorkloadType metadata. |
| `spec`| [`Spec`](#spec) | Y || A container for exposing the workload type definition. |

#### Metadata

The metadata describes this workload type. The metadata section is defined in [Section 3](3.component_model.md#metadata).

#### Spec

The specification describes how to declare that a component is bound to a workload type. In addition, it exposes which settings are configurable on the underlying workload runtime.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `group` | `string` | Y | | The group that this workload type belongs to (e.g. `core.oam.dev`)
| `version` | `string` | Y | | The version of the workload type API (e.g. `v1alpha1`)
| `names` | `Names` | Y | | Information about the names associated with this workload type |
| `workloadSettings` | `string` | Y | | The workload type's configuration options. The value is a [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) expressed as json string |

Declaration of non-container settings that should be passed to the workload runtime

The value of the workloadSettings field in a workload type definition is a [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) expressed as json string. When a workload type is used into a component instance, the workloadSettings are validated against the schema defined in the component's `workloadSettings` attribute.

For example, if a workload type defines a schema for workloadSettings that requires an array of integers with at least one member, the properties object is expected to be an array of integers with at least one member. During validation of the properties object, the component's workloadSettings schema will be applied.

It's almost the same with the [properties of Trait](./5.traits.md#properties). In addition, the schema defined for workload type in `JSON schema` should allow `fromParam` field when the type is `string`, `bool` or `number`. So the workloadSettings would be able to use values from parameters which could be overridded by the operator in Application Configuration.


The format of `group` is described in [the Group, Version, Kind section of part 2](2.overview_and_terminology.md)

#### Names

This section describes the different naming references for this kind.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `kind` | `string` | Y | | The proper reference name of the workload type (e.g., `Server`) |
| `singular` | `string` | N | | The singular human-readable name of this type (e.g., `server`) |
| `plural` | `string` | N | | The plural human-readable name of this type (e.g., `servers`) |

`kind` must begin with a capital letter, and contain only characters 0030-0039, 0041-005a, and 0061-007a from the Unicode basic Latin characters.

`singular` and `plural` can only contain characters from Unicode basic Latin 0030-0039 and 0061-007a.


### Examples

For example, we could define an OpenFaaS workload like below:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha1
kind: WorkloadType
metadata:
  name: OpenFaaS
  annotations:
    version: v1.0.0
    description: "OpenFaaS a Workload which can serve workload running as functions"
spec:
  group: openfaas.com
  version: v1alpha2
  names:
    kind: Function
    singular: function
    plural: functions
  workloadSettings: |
    {
      "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
      "type": "object",
      "required": [
        "name", "image"
      ],
      "properties": {
        "name": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "the name to the function"
        },
        "image": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "the docker image of the function"
        }
      }
    }
```

Use this workload in Component:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha1
kind: ComponentSchematic
metadata:
  name: go-echo
  annotations:
    version: v1.0.0
    description: "an echo server shows node info"
spec:
  workloadType: openfaas.com/v1alpha2.Function
  osType: linux
  workloadSettings:
    name: go-echo
    image: alexellisuk/go-echo:0.2.2
```

Then we could create AppConfig like below:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationConfiguration
metadata:
  name: extend-workload-app
  annotations:
    version: v1.0.0
    description: "Customized version of extend-workload-app"
spec:
  components:
    - componentName: go-echo
      instanceName: go-echo-instance
```
