# 3. The Component Model

This section defines the component model.

Components describe functional units that may be instantiated as part of a larger distributed application. For example, each microservice in an application is described as a component. The description itself is not an instance of that microservice, but a declaration of the operational capabilities of that microservice. [Section 6, Application Configuration](6.application_configuration.md) describes how components are grouped together and how instances of those components are then configured.

## Component Schematics

The role of a component schematic is to permit developers to declare, in infrastructure-neutral format, the operational characteristics of a discrete unit of execution.

For example, a single microservice may be modeled as a component.

## Units for Time, CPU, Memory, and Disk

In places in this specification, certain units of measure are applied. This section describes those units of measure.

### Timing (Intervals)

For timing, the default unit of time is seconds, represented as an integer.

### CPU count

CPU count is represented as a floating point number, where `1` means one CPU, `2` means 2 CPUs, and `0.5` means half of a CPU.

The exact meaning of this unit varies from platform to platform.  Implementors should consider that logical cpu is equivalent to one AWS vCPU or one Azure vCore or one GCP Core or one IBM vCPU. Fractional values are allowed. If a runtime does not support fractional units, it MUST round up (ceiling function) to the next integer value.

### Memory and Disk

Memory and disk space use the notation for bytes/kilo/mega/giga/tera/peta by just using the major unit:

- `1024` is 1024 bytes
- `88K` is 88 kilobytes
- `5M` is 5 megabytes
- `7G` is 7 gigabytes
- `100T` is 100 terabytes
- `9999P` is 9999 petabytes

If a `B` is appended after the unit letter, it MUST be ignored. Thus, `5M` and `5MB` are treated as identical. Case is unimportant. `15k` and `15K` MUST be treated as the same value.

## Representation

All component schematics are canonically represented as JSON and can be validated using the provided JSON Schema. Because it is more amenable for human consumption, YAML is also supported, and most of the examples are given in YAML. For the sake of validation, YAML may be converted to an equivalent JSON representation before validating it against the JSON Schema.

### Top-Level Attributes

The following attributes are common across all schemata defined in this document. This structure is designed to allow object type to be determined by scanning two fields (`apiVersion` and `kind`), and provide access to common fields in the `metadata` section. The `spec` section is where type-specific information is located, and in this section the `spec` section defines a `Component`.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `apiVersion` | `string` | Y || The specific version of the OAM specification in use. This version of the specification covers apiVersions in `core.oam.dev/v1alpha1`. |
| `kind` | `string` | Y || For a component schematic, must be `ComponentSchematic`. |
| `metadata` | [`Metadata`](2.overview_and_terminology.md#metadata) | Y | | Component metadata. |
| `spec`| [`Spec`](#spec) | Y || A container for all remaining attributes. |

### Spec

The spec defines the constituent parts of a component.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `parameters` | [`[]Parameter`](#parameter) | N | | The component's configuration options. |
| `workloadType` | `string` | Y | | A succinct, semantically meaningful descriptor of the component's runtime profile. See ["Workload Types"](#workload-types). |
| `osType` | `string` | N |  | The OS required to host (all of) the component's containers (since containers share a kernel with the underlying host). Possible values include:<ul><li>linux</li><li>windows</li></ul> For extended runtimes, this is passed in unaltered. Default can be none and let the runtime decide where to place the component. |
| `arch` | `string` | N |  | The CPU architecture required to host (all of) the component's containers (since containers share physical hardware with the underlying host). Possible values include:<ul><li>i386</li><li>amd64</li><li>arm</li><li>arm64</li></ul> Default can be none and let the runtime chose architecture. |
| `containers` | [`[]Container`](#container) | N | | The OCI container(s) that implement the component. |
| `workloadSettings` | [`Properties`](#properties) | N | | Declaration of non-container settings that should be passed to the workload runtime |
| `expose` | `string` | N | | The name of secret containing the information this component will output. The name MUST be unique in the same namespace |
| `consume` | [`[]Consume`](#consume) | N | | Where and how that the component will consume |


All core workload types require `containers` and MUST return an error and cease processing if the `containers` section is empty. However, extended workload types may not require containers. Thus this field is marked optional.

### Parameter

The Parameters section defines all of the configurable parameters for this component.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Y | | The parameter's name. Must be unique per component. |
| `description` | `string` | N | | A description of the parameter. |
| `type` | `string` | Y | | The parameter's type. One of `boolean`, `number`, `string`, or `null` as defined in [the JSON specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159) and the [JSON Schema Validation spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-handrews-json-schema-validation-01#section-6) |
| `required` | `boolean` | N |`false` | Whether a value _must_ be provided for the parameter. |
| `default` | type indicated by `type` field | N | | The parameter's default value. |

Parameter `name` fields must be Unicode letter and number characters.

### Workload Types

A _workload type_ is an indicator to the runtime as to how it should execute the given workload. In other words, it provides a single field by which the developer can indicate to the runtime how the developer intends for this component to be executed.

Workloads are named using a simple convention: `GROUP/VERSION.KIND`, where `GROUP` is a uniquely named service collection, `VERSION` is an API version, and `KIND` is a group-unique name of a service.

Examples:

- `core.oam.dev/v1alpha1.Singleton`: The group is `core.oam.dev`, meaning it is built-in. The version indicates that this is still an alpha version (`v1alpha1`). The kind is `Singleton`. This means the core singleton runtime must be used for this component.
- `azure.com/v1.Function`: The group is `azure.com` (which is a vendor-specific implementation, and may not be present on all runtimes). The version is `v1`, which marks this as stable. The kind is `Function`, whose runtime implementation is the Azure Functions offering.
- `streams.oam.dev/v1beta2.Kafka`: The group is `streams.oam.dev`, a hypothetical location where certain vendor-neutral extensions may exist. Version is `v1beta2`, indicating that it is moving toward stability. And the kind is `Kafka`.
- `caching.oam.dev/v2.Redis`: The group is `caching.oam.dev`, version is `v2`, and the kind is `Redis`. This describes an implementation of a Redis cache.

> Group, Version, Kind is a [convention in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/)

There are two kinds of workload types:

- Core workload types
- Extended workload types

#### Core Workload Types

The core workload types MUST be in the `core.oam.dev` group.

The core workload types MUST all be supported according to the definitions in this section by any runtime implementation of this specification.

Core workload types are focused on several distinguishing points:

1. Whether they are replicable. For singleton types, no replication or scaling traits may be assigned.
2. Whether they are daemonized. For daemon types, if the workload exits, this is considered a fault, and the system must fix it. For non-daemonized types, exit is considered a success if no error is reported.
3. Whether they have a service endpoint with a stable name for network traffic. Workload types that have a service endpoint need a virtual IP address (VIP) with a DNS name to represent the component as a whole, addressable within their network scope and can be assigned traffic routing traits.

All core workload types are container-based, and assume that an implementation is capable of executing an OCI or Docker image as a container, and are capable of working with OCI registries.

The following core workload types are defined by this specification:

|Name|Type|Service endpoint|Replicable|Daemonized|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Server|core.oam.dev/v1alpha1.Server|Yes|Yes|Yes
|Singleton Server|core.oam.dev/v1alpha1.SingletonServer|Yes|No|Yes
|Worker|core.oam.dev/v1alpha1.Worker|No|Yes|Yes
|Singleton Worker|core.oam.dev/v1alpha1.SingletonWorker|No|No|Yes
|Task|core.oam.dev/v1alpha1.Task|No|Yes|No
|Singleton Task|core.oam.dev/v1alpha1.SingletonTask|No|No|No

##### Server 
Workload type name: `core.oam.dev/v1alpha1.Server`

A Server is used for long-running, scalable workloads that have a network endpoint with a stable name to receive network traffic for the component as a whole. Common use cases include web applications and services that expose APIs. The Server workload type has the following characteristics:
 - Defines a container runtime where zero or more replicas of the same container may be run simultaneously. 
 - An application operator can increase or decrease the number of component replicas by applying and configuring traits when available. 
 - A Server is daemonized. A runtime MUST attempt to restart replicas that exit regardless of error code.
 - A Server has a network endpoint with an automatically assigned virtual IP address (VIP) and DNS name addressable within the network scope to which the component belongs.

> If a Server does not provide at least one `port` on at least one `container`, implementations SHOULD emit an error.


##### Singleton Server
Workload type name: `core.oam.dev/v1alpha1.SingletonServer`

A Singleton Server is a special case of the Server workload type that is limited to at most one replica. The Singleton Server workload type as the following characteristics:
 - Defines a container runtime where at most one replica of the same container may be run at a time.  
 - A Singleton Server is daemonized. A runtime MUST attempt to restart the singleton replica if it exits regardless of error code.
 - A Singleton Server has a network endpoint with an automatically assigned virtual IP address (VIP) and DNS name addressable within the network scope to which the component belongs.

> If a Singleton Server does not provide at least one `port` on at least one `container`, implementations SHOULD emit an error.

##### Worker
Workload type name: `core.oam.dev/v1alpha1.Worker`

A worker is used for long-running, scalable workloads that do not have a service endpoint for network requests, aside from optional liveliness and readiness probe endpoints on individual replicas. Workers are typically used to pull from queues or provide other offline processing. The worker workload type has the following characteristics:
 - Defines a container runtime where zero or more replicas of the same container may be run simultaneously. 
 - An application operator can increase or decrease the number of worker replicas by applying and configuring traits when available.
 - A worker is daemonized. A runtime MUST attempt to restart replicas that exit regardless of error code.

> If a Worker declares a `port` on any `container`, this SHOULD result in a validation error.

##### Singleton Worker
Workload type name: `core.oam.dev/v1alpha1.SingletonWorker`

A singleton worker is a special case of the worker workload type that is limited to at most one replica. The singleton worker workload type as the following characteristics:
 - Defines a container runtime where at most one replica of the same container may be run at a time.  
 - A singleton worker is daemonized. A runtime MUST attempt to restart the singleton replica if it exits regardless of error code.

> If a Singleton Worker declares a `port` on any `container`, this SHOULD result in a validation error.

##### Task
Workload type name: `core.oam.dev/v1alpha1.Task`

A task is used to run code or a script to completion. Commonly used to run cron jobs or one-time highly parallelizable tasks that exit and free up resources upon completion. The task workload type has the following characteristics:
 - Defines a container runtime where zero or more replicas of the same container may be run simultaneously.
 - An application operator can increase or decrease the number of worker replicas by applying and configuring traits when available
  - A task is non-daemonized. A runtime MUST NOT attempt to restart replicas that exit without an error code.

##### Singleton Task
Workload type name: `core.oam.dev/v1alpha1.SingletonTask`

A singleton task is a special case of the task workload type that is limited to at most one replica. The singleton task workload type as the following characteristics:
 - Defines a container runtime where at most one replica of the same container may be run at a time.  
  - A singleton task is non-daemonized. A runtime MUST NOT attempt to restart replicas that exit without an error code.


Core workload descriptions MUST include a `container` section in the component schematic. Implementations of the core workload types MUST NOT require that a `workloadSetting` list be present in the component description (though it may allow that some settings are passed that way only if their default values are sufficient for running a workload).

#### Extended Workload Types

Extended workload types are _per runtime_, meaning that each runtime may define its own extended workload types beyond this specification. In the present version of the spec, allowing user-defined extended workload types is _not supported_.

Extended workload types MAY use the `containers` section of the component schematic, or MAY omit it. Extended workload types MAY use or omit the `workloadSettings` field in the component schematic. The purpose of the `workloadSetting` field is to provide authors of extended workload types with a location for specifying the configuration of that types.

If an extended workload type is declared in a [component schematic](3.component_model.md), but is not provided by the current platform, the implementation MUST return an error and discontinue the operation.

### Container

This section describes the runtime configuration necessary to run a containerized workload for this component.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Y | | The container's name. Must be unique per component. |
| `image` | `string` | Y | | A path-like or URI-like representation of the location of an OCI image. Where applicable, this MAY be prefixed with a registry address, SHOULD be suffixed with a tag. |
| `resources` | [`Resources`](#resources) | Y | | Resources required by the container. |
| `cmd` | `[]string`| N | | Entrypoint array. |
| `args` | `[]string`| N | | Arguments to the entrypoint. The container image's CMD is used if this is not provided. |
| `env` | [`[]Env`](#env) | N | | Environment variables for the container. |
| `config` | [`[]ConfigFile`](#configfile) | N | | Locations to write configuration as files accessible within the container |
| `ports` | [`[]Port`](#port) | N | | Ports exposed by the container. |
| `livenessProbe` | [`HealthProbe`](#healthprobe) | N | | Instructions for assessing whether the container is alive. |
| `readinessProbe` | [`HealthProbe`](#healthprobe) | N | | Instructions for assessing whether the container is in a suitable state to serve traffic. |
| `imagePullSecret` | `string` | N | | Key that can be used to retrieve the credentials for pulling this secret. |

The details of the way that a runtime takes `imagePullSecret` and loads credentials is left to the OAM runtime implementation. For example, a Kubernetes implementation may treat this as a key that can be [loaded from a secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/).
While it is not required, it is RECOMMENDED that `image` names be suffixed with a digest in [OCI format](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/descriptor.md#digests). The digest may be used to compute the integrity of the image. `example/foobar@sha256:72e996751fe42b2a0c1e6355730dc2751ccda50564fec929f76804a6365ef5ef`.

> The name field is required and must be 63 characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with dashes (-), underscores (_), dots (.), and alphanumerics between.

### Properties

A properties is an object whose structure is determined by the workloadSettings schema. It may be a simple value, or a complex object.

Properties are validated against the schema appropriate for the workload type, trait or scope.

For example, if a workload type defines a schema for workloadSettings that requires an array of integers with at least one member, the `properties` object is expected to be an array of integers with at least one member. During validation of the `workloadSettings` object, the workload types's property schema will be applied.

If no schema is supplied, a property will be passed to the workload runtime without structural validation. As long as it parses as YAML or JSON, it will be considered valid.

In addition, the schema defined for workload type in `JSON schema` should allow `fromParam` field when the type is `string`, `bool` or `number`. So the workloadSettings would be able to use values from parameters which could be overridded by the operator in Application Configuration.

The `workloadSettings` section of a component schematic is an extensible location for specifying workload-specific configuration. The core workload types do not use this section, as it is reserved for extended workloads. Its primary purpose is to hold definitions for _non-containerized extended workload types_, though it may be used for containerized extended workload types where applicable.

> The name field is required and must be 63 characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with dashes (-), underscores (_), dots (.), and alphanumerics between.

The `workloadSettings` section of a component schematic is an extensible location for specifying workload-specific configuration. Its primary purpose is to hold definitions for _non-containerized extended workload types_, though it may be used for containerized workload types where applicable.

> The available settings are listed on the workload type object. See [section 7](7.workload_types.md) for details.

Workload settings are passed as name/value pairs, where the type of value may be anything supported by JSON/YAML. The runtime environment MAY choose to treat `workloadSettings` values as opaque, merely passing them directly to an implementing service. A runtime MAY return an error if certain constraints are not met, including:

- Missing an expected name/value pair
- An unrecognized key/value pair
- A malformed value
- An incompatibility based on the provided name/value pairs

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha1
kind: ComponentSchematic
metadata:
  name: ext-workload-example
spec:
  workloadType: ext.example.com/v1.ExtTask
  os: linux
  workloadSettings:
  - name: threshold
    type: numeric
    value: 55
  - name: workLabel
    type: string
```

The above illustrates a workload type with a few configurable settings.

### Resources

Resources describe compute resources attached to a runtime.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `cpu` | [`CPU`](#cpu) | Y |  | Specifies the attributes of the cpu resource required for the container. |
| `memory` | [`Memory`](#memory) | Y | | Specifies the attributes of the memory resource required for the container. |
| `gpu` | [`GPU`](#gpu) | N |  | Specifies the attributes of the gpu resources required for the container. |
| `volumes` | [`[]Volume`](#volume) | N | | Specifies the attributes of the volumes that the container uses. |
| `extended` | [`[]ExtendedResource`](#extendedresource) | N | | Implementation-specific extended resource requirements |

For any resource that cannot be satisfied by the underlying platform, the platform MUST return an error and cease deployment. A resource is considered a requirement, and failure to meet that requirement means the runtime MUST NOT deploy the application. For example, if an application requests `1P` of memory, and that amount of memory is not available, the application deployment must fail. Likewise, if an application requires `1` gpu, and the runtime does not provide gpus, the application deployment MUST fail.

#### CPU

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `required` | `double` | Y |  | The minimum number of logical cpus required for running this container. |

See the Units section above for valid values.

#### Memory

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `required` | `string` | Y | | The minimum amount of memory required for running this container. The value should be a positive integer with/without unit suffix: P, T, G, M, K. If no unit is given, it defaults to 'bytes'. |

See the Units section above for valid values.

#### GPU

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `required` | `double` | Y |  | The minimum number of gpus  required for running this container. |

See the Units section above for valid values.

#### Volume

Volume describes name, a location to mount the volume, along with access mode (such as read/write or read-only) and sharing policy for the mount. It also describes the underneath disk attributes needed by the volume.
The format of the path is specific to the operating system of the consuming component, though implementations SHOULD provide support for UNIX-like path representations.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Y |  | Specifies the name used to reference the path. |
| `mountPath` | `string` | Y |  | Specifies the actual mount path in the filesystem. |
| `accessMode` | `string` | N | `RW` | Specifies the access mode. Allowed values are `RW` (read/write) and `RO` (read-only). |
| `sharingPolicy` | `string` | N | `Exclusive` | The sharing policy for the mount, indicating if it is expected to be shared or not. Allowed values are `Exclusive` and `Shared`. |
| `disk` | [`Disk`](#disk) | N |  | Specifies the attributes of the underneath disk resources required by the volume. |

See the Units section above for valid values.

Example:

```yaml
name: "configuration"
mountPath: /etc/config
accessMode: RO
sharingPolicy: Shared
disk:
  required: "2G"
  ephemeral: n
```

The above requires that a read-only volume be mounted at the path `/etc/config`, backed by a volume that provides at least 2G of non-ephemeral storage.

#### Disk

The disk specifies the attributes of the disk used by the volume. It describes information such as minimum disk size and the disk is ephemeral or not. Ephemeral disk indicates the component requires minimum disk size on the node to run it. For example, image processing component may require a larger cache on the node to run could use ephemeral disk. When ephemeral disk is set to false, it indicates external disk will be used.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `required` | `string` | Y |  | The minimum disk size required for running this container. The value should be a positive value, greater than zero. |
| `ephemeral` | `boolean` | N | | Specifies whether external disk needs to be mounted or not. |

See the Units section above for valid values.

#### ExtendedResource

An extended resource is a declaration of a resource requirement for an implementation-specific resource. For example, OAM-compliant platforms may expose special hardware. This field allows containers to indicate that such special offerings are required in order for the containers to operate.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Y | | The name of the resource, as a Group/Version/Kind |
| `required` | `string` | Y | | The required condition. |

The `name` field MUST be a group/version/kind identifying the specific resource.

Example:

```yaml
extended:
- name: ext.example.com/v1.MotionSensor
  required: "1"
- name: ext.example.com/v2beta4.ServoModel
  required: z141155-t100
```

If the named extended resource is not available for any reason, implementations MUST return an error when a component instance is created.

### Env

Env describes an environment variable as a name/value pair of strings.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Y || The environment variable name. Must be unique per container. |
| `value` | `string` | N || The environment variable value. If this is not supplied, `fromParam` must be supplied |
| `fromParam` | `string` | N || The parameter whose value should be substituted into this variable as a value |

The `name` field must be composed of valid Unicode letter and number characters, as well as `_` and `-`.

Example:

```yaml
env:
  - name: "ADMIN_USER"
    value: "admin"  # This is a literal value
  - name: "LOGO_URL"
    fromParam: "logoURL" # This will cause the value to be read from the parameter whose name is `logoURL`
```

If both `fromParam` and `value` are specified, `fromParam` MUST take precedence, even if the parameter value is an empty value. If neither is specified, the runtime MUST produce an error.

### ConfigFile

ConfigFile describes a path to a file available within the container, as well as the data that will be written into that file. This provides a way to inject configuration files into a container.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `path` | `string` | Y || An absolute path within the container. |
| `value` | `string` | N || The data to be written into the file at the specified path. If this is not supplied, `fromParam` must be supplied |
| `fromParam` | `string` | N || The parameter whose value should be written into this file as a value |

The `path` field must contain a path that abides by the pathing rules of the underlying operating system. If a relative path is given, implementations MUST assume the path is relative to the root directory of the container. Implementations MAY produce an error if using such a path would violate security measures or path layout requirements.

Example:

```yaml
config:
  - path: "/etc/access/default_user.txt"
    value: "admin"  # This is a literal value
  - path: "/var/run/db-data"
    fromParam: "sourceData" # This will cause the value to be read from the parameter whose name is `sourceData`
```

If both `fromParam` and `value` are specified, `fromParam` MUST take precedence, even if the parameter value is an empty value. If neither is specified, the runtime MUST produce an error.

### Port

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Y || A descriptive name for the port. Must be unique per container. |
| `containerPort` | `integer` | Y || The port number. Must be unique per container. |
| `protocol` | `string` | N | `TCP` | Indicates the transport layer protocol used by the server listening on the port. Valid values are `TCP` and `UDP`. |

The `name` field must be lowercase alphabetical characters as present in the ASCII character set (0061-007A).

### HealthProbe

Health Probe describes how a probing operation is to be executed as a way of determining the health of a component.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `exec` | [`Exec`](#exec) | N || Instructions for assessing container health by executing a command. Either this attribute or the `httpGet` attribute or the `tcpSocket` attribute MUST be specified. This attribute is mutually exclusive with both the `httpGet` attribute and the `tcpSocket` attribute. |
| `httpGet` | [`HTTPGet`](#httpget) | N || Instructions for assessing container health by executing an HTTP GET request. Either this attribute or the `exec` attribute or the `tcpSocket` attribute MUST be specified. This attribute is mutually exclusive with both the `exec` attribute and the `tcpSocket` attribute. |
| `tcpSocket` | [`TCPSocket`](#tcpsocket) | N || Instructions for assessing container health by probing a TCP socket. Either this attribute or the `exec` attribute or the `httpGet` attribute MUST be specified. This attribute is mutually exclusive with both the `exec` attribute and the `httpGet` attribute. |
| `initialDelaySeconds` | `integer` | N | `0` | Number of seconds after the container is started before the first probe is initiated. |
| `periodSeconds` | `integer` | N | `10` | How often, in seconds, to execute the probe. |
| `timeoutSeconds` | `integer` | N | `1` | Number of seconds after which the probe times out. |
| `successThreshold` | `integer` | N | `1` | Minimum consecutive successes for the probe to be considered successful after having failed. |
| `failureThreshold` | `integer` | N | `3` | Number of consecutive failures required to determine the container is not alive (liveness probe) or not ready (readiness probe). |

See the Units section above for valid time values.

### Exec

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `command` | `[]string` | Y || A command to be executed inside the container to assess its health. Each space delimited token of the command is a separate array element. Commands exiting `0` are considered to be successful probes, whilst all other exit codes are considered failures. |

### HTTPGet

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `path` | `string` | Y || The endpoint, relative to the `port`, to which the HTTP GET request should be directed. |
| `port` | `integer` | Y || The TCP socket within the container to which the HTTP GET request should be directed. |
| `httpHeaders` | [`[]HTTPHeader`](#httpheader) | N || Optional HTTP headers. |

### HTTPHeader

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Y || An HTTP header name. This must be unique per HTTP GET-based probe. |
| `value` | `string` | Y || An HTTP header value. |

Both `name` and `value` must abide by the HTTP/1.1 specification for valid [header values](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.2)

### TCPSocket

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `port` | `integer` | Y || The TCP socket within the container that should be probed to assess container health. |

Port must be an integer value greater than `0`.


### Consume

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Y | | The data's name. Must be unique per component. |
| `as` | `string` | N | | How the data could be exposed or consumed, for example: env, file.. |

admins) authenticate using basic authentication. The interface permits end users
to configure what kind of content the bot will tweet and the intervals at which
it will do so.

Because this component is stateless, horizontally scalable, and exposes an endpoint, it is best described
as a `Server`. The username, password, and address of the backend
component are configurable.

    readinessProbe:

        port: 8080
        path: /healthz
```

Our second component implements both the backend for our Twitter bot's
administrative interface and a background worker process that will Tweet
end-user-defined content at end-user-defined intervals (defined through the
administrative interface). This component also persists its end-user-defined
configuration to disk as a JSON file.

This component's design prevents it from scaling horizontally so we should only
have at most _one_ instance of it running. It also has an endpoint for an administrative interface. As such, this component is best described
as a `SingletonServer`. Connection details for the Twitter API are
configurable. The component schematic also describes the file system location
where the component persists end-user-defined configuration.

#### Example: Extended Workload Type

Imagine a service runtime that checks out code from a Git repository and executes it as an Azure function. This service might be used as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha1
kind: ComponentSchematic
metadata:
  name: azurefunction
  annotations:
    version: v1.0.0
    description: "Extended workflow example"
spec:
  workloadType: azure.com/v1.Function
  parameters:
  - name: github-token
    description: GitHub API session key
    type: string
    required: true
  workloadSettings:
    - name: source
      value: git://git.example.com/function/myfunction.git
    - name: github_token
      fromParam: github-token
```
