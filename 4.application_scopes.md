# 4. Application Scopes

Application scopes are used to group components together into logical applications by providing different forms of application boundaries with common group behaviors.

Application scopes have the following general characteristics:
 - Application scopes SHOULD be used when defining behavior or metadata that is common to a group of component instances.
 - A component MAY be deployed into multiple application scopes of different types simultaneously. 
 - Application scope types MAY determine whether or not components can be deployed into multiple instances of the same application scope type simultaneously. 
 - Application scopes MAY be used as a connecting mechanism between groups of components and capabilities provided by infrastructure, such as networking, or external capabilities, such as identity providers.

The following diagram illustrates how components can be grouped into overlapping application scopes to create different application boundaries:

![Scope diagram][scope-diagram-1]

This example shows two scope types with four components distributed among them.

Components A, B, and C are deployed to the same health scope. The health scope will collect aggregate health information on its constituent components that is evaluated during component upgrade operations. Query information provided by the health scope can be further used by traits or components that need to evaluate and/or perform actions based on the aggregate health of a set of components. This is a basic grouping construct for applications that provides a loose definition of dependencies between components.

Component A is isolated in its own network scope from components B, C, and D. This allows the infrastructure operator to supply different SDN settings for different groups of components, such as more restricted inbound/outbound rules on back-end components.

## Application scope types
There are two kinds of application scope types:
 - Core application scope types
 - Extended application scope types

### Core application scope types
Core application scope types define grouping constructs for basic runtime behavior. They have the following characteristics:

 - Core application scope types MUST be in the `core.hydra.io` namespace.
 - Core application scope types MUST all be supported by any implementation of the specification. They may be implemented by any available feature in the platform, but they MUST be implemented according to the specification of each core application scope type.
 - Instances of core *workload* types MUST be deployed into an instance of each core application scope type. 
 - Runtimes MUST provide a default "root" application scope instance for each core application scope type.
 - Runtimes MUST deploy each component instances into default "root" application scope instances when an application configuration does not otherwise specify an application scope for a component instance.

 The following core application scope types are defined by this specification:

| Name | Type | Description | 
|-----------|------|----------|
|Network|`core.hydra.io/v1alpha1.Network` | This scope groups components into a network subnet boundaries and defines the general runtime networking model. Network definitions, rules, and policies are described by the infrastructure's network or SDN.
|Health|`core.hydra.io/v1alpha1.Health` | This scope groups components into an aggregate health group. The aggregate health of the constituent components within the group supplies information to upgrade and rollback mechanisms.  |

### Extended application scope types

Extended application scopes are optional per runtime, meaning that each runtime may choose which extended scopes are supported. In this version of the spec, allowing user-defined extended application scope types is not supported.

## Defining an application scope
This section is normative because application scopes are an inspectable (and possibly shareable) part of the system. All scopes MUST be representable in the following format.

Application scopes are defined with schematics like components and traits.

### Top-Level Attributes

The following attributes are common across all schemata defined in this document. This structure is designed to allow object type to be determined by scanning two fields (`apiVersion` and `kind`), and provide access to common fields in the `metadata` section. The `spec` section is where type-specific information is located, and in this section the `spec` section defines a `Scope`.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `apiVersion` | `string` | Y || The specific version of the Hydra specification in use. This version of the specification covers apiVersions in `core.hydra.io/v1alpha1`. |
| `kind` | `string` | Y || For a scope schematic, must be `ApplicationScope`. |
| `metadata` | [`Metadata`](#metadata) | Y | | Scope metadata. |
| `spec`| [`Spec`](#spec) | Y || A container for all remaining attributes. |

### Metadata

Metadata provides information about the contents of this object.The metadata section is defined in [Section 3](3.component_model.md#metadata). 

### Spec

The spec defines the constituent parts of a scope. 

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `type` | `string` | Y | | Determines type of the application scope. The core types are defined [above](#core-application-scope-types) |
| `allowComponentOverlap` | `bool` | Y | | Determines whether a component is allowed to be in multiple instances of this scope type simultaneously. When false, the runtime implementation MUST produce an error and stop deployment if an attempt is made to place a component into more than one instance of this scope type simultaneously. |
| `parameters` | [`[]Parameter`](#parameter) | N | | The scope's configuration options. |

The `type` field defines the type name for this type. Examples may be found in the [Core Application Scope Types](#core-application-scope-types) above. Extended scope types MUST NOT be in the `core.hydra.io` namespace.  However, they must follow the [group, version, kind notation](2.overview_and_terminology.md). For example: `scopes.example.com/v1.ExtendedNetworkScope`

#### Parameter

The parameters that a scope exposes to operators.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Y | | The parameter's name. Must be unique per scope. |
| `description` | `string` | N | | A description of the parameter. |
| `type` | `string` | Y | | The parameter's type (One of `string`, `boolean`, `number`). |
| `required` | `boolean` | N |`false` | Whether a value _must_ be provided for the parameter. |
| `default` | type indicated by `type` field | N | | The parameter's default value. |

## Deployment
Application scope instances are defined and deployed in an application configuration. See [Application Configuration](6.application_configuration.md) for more information on deploying scopes.

## Core scope type definitions
The following core scope types are available:
- network scope
- health scope

### Network scope
The network scope groups components together and links them to a network or SDN. The network itself must be defined and operated by the infrastructure.

The network scope may also be queried by traffic management traits to determine discoverability boundaries for a service mesh or API boundaries for API gateways.

If no network scope is assigned, the platform MUST join the application to a default network. Within that default network, all components in the application configuration MUST be able to communicate to each other, and health probes MUST be able to contact any components who define health checking rules. The network joined, however, is platform-dependent. For example, cluster-based environments (such as Kubernetes) declare cluster-wide networks. Conversely, a truly serverless implementation may join the components to a network that only includes the components and the health checking probes.

#### Example
This is an example of a network scope definition. 
```yaml
apiVersion: core.hydra.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationScope
metadata:
  name: myNetworkScope
  annotations:
    version: v1.0.0
    description: "The production configuration for Corp CMS"
spec:
  type: core.hydra.io/v1.NetworkScope
  allowComponentOverlap: false
  parameters:
    - name: networkName
      description: The name of the network
      type: string
      required: N
      default: networkScope1
    - name: ingressVisibility
      description: True if ingress should be publically visable
      type: boolean
      required: Y
      default: false
```

### Health scope
The health scope aggregates health states for components. Parameters of the health scope can be set to determine the percentage of components that must be unhealthy to consider the entire scope unhealthy.

The health scope on its own does not take any action based on health status. It is only a group health aggregator that can be queried and used by other processes and parts of an application, such as:
 - Application upgrade traits can monitor the aggregate health of a health scope and decide when to initiate an automatic rollback.
 - Monitoring applications can monitor the aggregate health of a health scope to issue alerts.

The health scope is defined by the following spec:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.hydra.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationScope
metadata:
  name: health
  annotations:
    version: v1.0.0
    description: "aggregated health state for a group of components."
spec:
  type: core.hydra.io/v1alpha1.HealthScope
  allowComponentOverlap: true
  parameters:
    - name: probe-method
      description: The method to probe the components, e.g. 'httpGet'.
      type: string
      required: true
    - name: probe-endpoint
      description: The endpoint to probe from the components, e.g. '/v1/health'.
      type: string
      required: true
    - name: probe-timeout
      description: The amount of time in seconds to wait when receiving a response before marked failure.
      type: integer
      required: false
    - name: probe-interval
      description: The amount of time in seconds between probing tries.
      type: integer
      required: false
    - name: failure-rate-threshold
      description: If the rate of failure of total probe results is above this threshold, declared 'failed'.
      type: double
      required: false
    - name: healthy-rate-threshold
      description: If the rate of healthy of total probe results is above this threshold, declared 'healthy'.
      type: double
      required: false
    - name: healthThresholdPercentage
      description: The % of healthy components required to upgrade scope
      type: double
      required: N
    - name: requiredHealthyComponents
      description: Comma-separated list of names of the components required to be healthy for the scope to be health.
      type: string
      required: N
```

## Extended application scope type definitions
The following extended scope types are available:
- resource quota scope
- identity scope

### Resource Quota scope
The resource quota scope sets resource quotas on a group of components. Resources include CPU, memory, storage, etc. Setting resource quotas for a scope applies across all components within the scope; in other words, the total resource consumption for all components within a scope cannot exceed a certain value.

#### Example
This is an example of a resource quota scope definition. 
```yaml
apiVersion: core.hydra.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationScope
metadata:
  name: myResourceQuotas
  annotations:
    version: v1.0.0
    description: "The production configuration for Corp CMS"
spec:
  type: resources.hydra.io/v1.ResourceQuotaScope
  allowComponentOverlap: false
  parameters:
    - name: CPU
      description: maximum CPU to be consumed by this scope
      type: double
      required: Y
    - name: Memory
      description: maximum memory to be consumed by this scope
      type: double
      required: Y
```

### Identity scope

The identity scope provides identities in components when authenticating to any service. The identities and its credentials are supplied and managed by an external identity provider.

#### Example
This is an example of a identity scope definition. 
```yaml
apiVersion: core.hydra.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationScope
metadata:
  name: myIdentityScope
  annotations:
    version: v1.0.0
    description: "The production configuration for Corp CMS"
spec:
  type: identity.hydra.io/v1.IdentityScope
  allowComponentOverlap: true
  parameters:
    - name: IdentityProvider
      description: the provider of identity for the scope
      type: string
      required: Y
```
