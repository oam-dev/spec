# 3. Workload
**Target Audience: Infrastructure Operator** 

This section defines the workload definition schematics.

Usually, workload definitions are provided by the OAM runtime (just as traits are) so that application developers may inspect the OAM runtime and learn what workloads are available for use.  

## Top-Level Attributes

The following attributes are common across all schemata defined in this document. They follow the [Kubernetes specification](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/#required-fields).

Here are the attributes that provide top-level information about the workload definition.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `apiVersion` | `string` | Y | | The specific version of the specification in use. The core types use `core.oam.dev/v1alpha2` |
| `kind` | `string` | Y || The string `WorkloadDefinition` |
| `metadata` | [`Metadata`](#metadata) | Y | | WorkloadDefinition metadata. |
| `spec`| [`Spec`](#spec) | Y | | A container for the workload definition. |

### Metadata

The metadata describes this workload definition. The `metadata` section is defined in [the meta section of part 2](2.overview_and_terminology.md#Metadata)

### Spec

The specification section contains a reference to the workload definition.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `definitionRef` | [`DefinitionRef`](#DefinitionRef) | Y | | Workload schema reference. |


#### DefinitionRef

DefinitionRef defines an index to find the workload schema.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Y | | The workload schema's name. |

The workload schema definition itself __MUST__ contain information that can be used to uniquely identify it. An OAM runtime will use that information in a [Component](4.component.md) to refer to the workload schema instead of using the name of the workload definition.
 We recommend to use the format [Group/Version/Kind](2.overview_and_terminology.md#Group) described in section 2 as the unique identification in the schema. 

We recommend that the `name` here follows the format described in [the Representations of Group/Kind in section 2](2.overview_and_terminology.md#Representations).

We also recommend that the `name` of the workloadDefinition to be the same as the `name` it refers to. Here is an example

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
kind: WorkloadDefinition
metadata:
  name: schema.example.oam.dev
spec:
  definitionRef:
    schemaName: schema.example.oam.dev
```

## Categories of Workload

There are three categories of workloads:

__Core workloads__ are the kind of workloads that every OAM runtime MUST implement according to spec definition.

__Standard workloads__ are the kind of workloads that a OAM runtime can choose to implement. However, the implementation MUST strictly adhere to the schematics defined in the spec. 

__Extended workloads__ are the kind of workloads that a OAM runtime is free to define.

### Core Workload

A core workload schema MUST be in the `core.oam.dev` group. A core workload MUST all be supported according to the definitions in the spec by any runtime implementation of this specification. Here is an example of a core workload definition.

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
kind: WorkloadDefinition
metadata:
  name: x.core.oam.dev
spec:
  definitionRef:
    name: x.core.oam.dev
```

Currently, all core workloads are container-based, and assume that an implementation is capable of executing an OCI or Docker image as a container, and are capable of working with OCI registries.
We may introduce non container-based workloads, such as VM-based, in the future. We can also promote standard workloads to core if there is a consensus in the community.

### Standard Workload

A standard workload schema MUST be in the `standard.oam.dev` group. Here is an example of a standard workload definition.

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
kind: WorkloadDefinition
metadata:
  name: x.standard.oam.dev
spec:
  definitionRef:
    name: x.standard.oam.dev
```

A standard workload MUST be implemented according to the definitions in the spec if any runtime chooses to implement it.
 
We do not have any standard workload defined in the current spec. We may introduce new workloads or promote extended workloads to standard if there is a consensus in the community.
 
### Extended Workload
Each OAM runtime may define its own extended workloads schema beyond this specification. An OAM runtime is also free to incorporate extended workloads defined by application developers. Here is an example of a standard workload definition.


```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
kind: WorkloadDefinition
metadata:
  name: foo.cache.io
spec:
  definitionRef:
    name: foo.cache.io
```
      

## Core Workload definitions
The following core workloads are defined in our current OAM specification.

### Containerized Workload
A containerized workload is used for long-running workloads. Here is the [definition](core/workloads/containerized_workload/containerized_workload.md) of the containerized workload.
