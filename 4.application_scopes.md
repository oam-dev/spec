# 4. Application Scopes

Application scopes are used to group components together into logical applications by providing different forms of application boundaries with common group behaviors.

Application scopes have the following general characteristics:
 - Application scopes SHOULD be used when defining behavior or metadata that is common to a group of component instances.
 - A component MAY be deployed into multiple application scopes of different types simultaneously. 
 - Application scope types MAY determine whether or not components can be deployed into multiple instances of the same application scope type simultaneously. 
 - Application scopes MAY be used as a connecting mechanism between groups of components and capabilities provided by infrastructure, such as networking, or external capabilities, such as identity providers.

The following diagram illustrates how components can be grouped into overlapping application scopes to create different application boundaries:

![Scope diagram][scope-diagram-1]

This example shows two scope types with four components distributed among them.

Components A, B, and C are deployed to the same health scope. The health scope will collect aggregate health information on its constituent components that is evaluated during component upgrade operations. Query information provided by the health scope can be further used by traits or components that need to evaluate and/or perform actions based on the aggregate health of a set of components. This is a basic grouping construct for applications that provides a loose definition of dependencies between components.

Component A is isolated in its own network scope from components B, C, and D. This allows the infrastructure operator to supply different SDN settings for different groups of components, such as more restricted inbound/outbound rules on back-end components.


## Application scope types
There are two kinds of application scope types:
 - Core application scope types
 - Extended application scope types

### Core application scope types
Core application scope types define grouping constructs for basic runtime behavior. They have the following characteristics:

 - Core application scope types MUST be in the `core.hydra.io` namespace.
 - Core application scope types MUST all be supported by any implementation of the specification. They may be implemented by any available feature in the platform, but they MUST be implemented according to the specification of each core application scope type.
 - Instances of core *workload* types MUST be deployed into an instance of each core application scope type. 
 - Runtimes MUST provide a default "root" application scope instance for each core application scope type.
 - Runtimes MUST deploy each component instances into default "root" application scope instances when an operational configuration does not otherwise specify an application scope for a component instance.

 The following core application scope types are defined by this specification:

| Name | Type | Description | 
|-----------|------|----------|
|Network|`core.hydra.io/v1alpha1.Network| This scope groups components into a network subnet boundaries and defines the general runtime networking model. Network definitions, rules, and policies are described by the intrastructure's network or SDN.
|Health|`core.hydra.io/v1alpha1.Health| This scope groups components into an aggregate health group. The aggregate health of the constituent components within the group supplies information to upgrade and rollback mechanisms.  |

### Extended application scope types

Extended application scopes are optional per runtime, meaning that each runtime may choose which extended scopes are supported. In this version of the spec, allowing user-defined extended application scope types is not supported.


## Defining an application scope
This section is normative because application scopes are an inspectable (and possibly shareable) part of the system. All scopes MUST be representable in the following format.

Application scopes are defined with schematics like components and traits.

### Top-Level Attributes

The following attributes are common across all schemata defined in this document. This structure is designed to allow object type to be determined by scanning two fields (`apiVersion` and `kind`), and provide access to common fields in the `metadata` section. The `spec` section is where type-specific information is located, and in this section the `spec` section defines a `Scope`.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `apiVersion` | `string` | Y || The specific version of the Hydra specification in use. This version of the specification covers apiVersions in `core.hydra.io/v1alpha1`. |
| `kind` | `string` | Y || For a scope schematic, must be `ApplicationScope`. |
| `metadata` | `Metadata(#metadata)` | Y | | Scope metadata. |
| `spec`| [`Spec`](#spec) | Y || A container for all remaining attributes. |

### Metadata

Metadata provides information about the contents of this object.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Y | | the name of the scope. |
| `description` | `string` | Y | | A short description of the scope. |
| `version` | `string` | Y | | A string defining the [semantic version](https://semver.org/) of the scope. |
| `labels` | `map[string]string` | N | | A set of string key/value pairs used as arbitrary labels on this scope. | 

### Spec

The spec defines the constituent parts of a scope. 

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `allowComponentOverlap` | `bool` | Y | | Determines whether a component is allowed to be in multiple instances of this scope type simultaneously. When false, the runtime implementation MUST produce an error and stop deployment if an attempt is made to place a component into more than one instance of this scope type simultaneously. |
| `parameters` | [`[]Parameter`](#parameter) | N | | The scope's configuration options. |



#### Parameter

The parameters that a scope exposes to operators.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Y | | The parameter's name. Must be unique per scope. |
| `description` | `string` | N | | A description of the parameter. |
| `type` | `string` | Y | | The parameter's type (One of `string`, `boolean`, `number`). |
| `required` | `boolean` | N |`false` | Whether a value _must_ be provided for the parameter. |
| `default` | type indicated by `type` field | N | | The parameter's default value. |

## Deployment
Application scope instances are defined and deployed in an operational configuration. See [Operational Configuration](6.operational_configuration.md) for more information on deploying scopes.


## Core scope type definitions
The following core scope types are available:
- network scope
- health scope

### Network scope
The network scope groups components together and links them to a network or SDN. The network itself must be defined and operated by the infrastructure.

The network scope may also be queried by traffic management traits to determine discoverability boundaries for a service mesh or API boundaries for API gateways.

#### Example
This is an example of a network scope definition. 
```yaml
schemaVersion: core.hydra.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationScope
metadata:
  name: myNetworkScope
  description: The production configuration for Corp CMS
spec:
  type: core.hydra.io/v1.NetworkScope
  parameters:
    - name: networkName     
      description: The name of the network
      type: string
      required: N
      default: networkScope1
    - name: ingressVisability     
      description: True if ingress should be publically visable
      type: boolean
      required: Y
      default: false
```

### Health scope
The health scope aggregates health states for components. Parameters of the health scope can be set to determine the percentage of components that must be unhealthy to consider  the entire scope unhealthy.

The health scope on its own does not take any action based on health status. It is only a group health aggregator that can be queried and used by other processes and parts of an application, such as:
 - Application upgrade traits can monitor the aggregate health of a health scope and decide when to initiate an automatic rollback.
 - Monitoring applications can monitor the aggregate health of a health scope to issue alerts.

#### Example
This is an example of a health scope definition. 
```yaml
schemaVersion: core.hydra.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationScope
metadata:
  name: myHealthScope
  description: The production configuration for Corp CMS
spec:
  type: core.hydra.io/v1.HealthScope
  parameters:
    - name: healthThresholdPercentage     
      description: The % of healthy components required to upgrade scope
      type: double
      required: Y
    - name: LogAnalyticsWorkspaceId
      description: an Id for a unique environment for Azure Monitor log data
      type: string
      required: false
    - name: LogAnalyticsWorkspaceKey
      description: a key for a unique environment for Azure Monitor log data
      type: string
      required: false
```


## Extended application scope type definitions
The following extended scope types are available:
- resource quota scoe
- identity scope

### Resource Quota scope
The resource quota scope sets resource quotas on a group of components. Resources include CPU, memory, storage, etc. Setting resource quotas for a scope applies across all components within the scope; in other words, the total resource consumption for all components within a scope cannot exceed a certain value.

#### Example
This is an example of a resource quota scope definition. 
```yaml
schemaVersion: core.hydra.io/v1alpha1
kind: Scope
metadata:
  name: myResourceQuotas
  description: The production configuration for Corp CMS
spec:
  type: core.hydra.io/v1.ResourceQuotaScope
  parameters:
     - name: CPU     
      description: maximum CPU to be consumed by this scope
      type: double
      required: Y
     - name: Memory     
      description: maximum memory to be consumed by this scope
      type: double
      required: Y
```

### Identity scope
The identity scope uses an external identity provider to supply 

#### Example
This is an example of a identity scope definition. 
```yaml
schemaVersion: core.hydra.io/v1alpha1
kind: Scope
metadata:
  name: myResourceQuotas
  description: The production configuration for Corp CMS
spec:
  type: core.hydra.io/v1.IdentityScope
  parameters:
     - name: IdentityProvider     
      description: the provider of identity for the scope
      type: string
      required: Y
```
