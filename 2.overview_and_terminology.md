# 2. Overview and Terminology

This section provides an overview of the specification and the terminology. It begins by identifying the organization roles that are involved in the process of running cloud native applications. From there, it lays out the specific terminology that is used throughout this document.

## Roles and Responsibilities

As a foundation for the specification, the following roles are defined. These are extracted from a combination of user stories, research, and user input. While this is not an exhaustive list of possible roles, these are the roles identified as the primary targets for this specification.

- __Developers__ deliver business value in the form of code. While they should understand the operational characteristics of the code they deliver, they are unconcerned with _how_ operational requirements are fulfilled. For instance, a developer may be aware that their code writes data to a specific path on a file system, but need not concern themselves with what kind of volume (disk) is mounted to that path or how that dependency is fulfilled.

- __Application operators__ deliver business value by configuring, installing, and managing components and/or applications. Unlike developers and application composers, operators are concerned with _how_ a component or application's operational requirements are fulfilled. For instance, if a developer has declared that a component writes data to a specific path on a file system, an operator may concern themselves with mounting an appropriate volume to that path.

- __Infrastructure operators__ deliver value by managing low-level infrastructural components. This may range from managing the physical hardware in an on-premises network to directly managing cloud service offerings in a public cloud. Infrastructure operators are less concerned with the particular configuration needs of _an application_, focusing instead on the big picture of how an enterprise's overall infrastructure is managed. For example, an infrastructure operator may manage the underlying storage offerings that are used for provisioning persistent storage.

In many organizations, some individuals may fulfill more than one of the above roles. And as the examples above illustrate, the roles often work together to collectively manage an enterprise's applications.

## Overview of the Model

This specification proposes a model that defines cloud native applications as follows:

> A cloud native application is a collection of interrelated, but discrete _components_ (services, tasks, workers) that, when coupled with configuration and instantiated in a suitable runtime, together accomplish a unified functional purpose.

The application model defines the following:

 - _Components_ represents a runnable unit, together with a description (schematic).
 - _Workload types_ identify the different workloads that a component can execute.
 - _Traits_ are overlays that augment a component with additional operations-specific features. Traits represent operator concerns, not developer concerns.
 - _Application scopes_ represent application boundaries by grouping components with common properties or dependencies.
 - An _operational configuration_ describes a set of component instances, their traits, and the application scopes in which they are placed, combined with configuration parameters and metadata.

Thus, an _application_ is a collection of _components_ with a set of operational traits and scoped together into one or more application boundaries. 

## Group, Version, and Kind

Many of the API objects described in this document use a naming scheme called "Group, Version, Kind." This scheme, popularized by Kubernetes, provides a consistent way of namespacing and versioning API objects, and it is used here for Hydra API versioning.

> Applications, components, containers, and other entities may have their own versioning schemes. This scheme is solely for the API objects like Component Schematic, Application Schematic, Workload Types, and Traits.

This section describes the scheme.

### Group

Group is a namespace for collecting several related kinds. Groups use a DNS naming convention. Example groups are:

- components.hydra.io
- functions.azure.com
- my.dev

All of the groups under the `hydra.io` domain are considered reserved for the specification. And all of the objects specified herein belong to groups in that domain.

Group MUST be globally unique.

### Version

The version string is an API version. Following the common paradigm, APIs are versioned by major number only. Minor and patch numbers are omitted from API versions. The actual minor and patch versions of the underlying engines may iterate, but they MUST iterate this version for any breaking change. In other words, the major number serves as a guarantee of compatibility, and minor and patch numbers should not change that guarantee. Therefore, consumers of the API cannot specify a finer granularity than the major version.

An API version number is always prefixed by a `v`, followed by one or more digits.

Examples:

- `v1`
- `v2`
- `v973`

There are two additional modifiers that are part of the major version number:

- `alphaN` (where `N` is one or more digits) indicates that this feature is experimental, and may be removed, but that its current compatibility marker is `1`
- `betaN` (where `N` is one or more digits) indicates that this feature is not yet stable. The `N` is a compatibility marker.

API versions that are marked either `alpha` or `beta` are considered unstable and susceptible to breaking changes.

Only one of the two modifiers may be applied at a time:

- `v1alpha1`
- `v973beta231`

Compatibility is established by _exact match only_. `v1` is not considered compatible with `v2`, `v1alpha1`, or `v1beta2`. 

Versions do not have a uniqueness requirement.

### Kind

The _kind_ is the name of a type. For example, a component schematic's kind is `ComponentSchematic`, while a trait's kind is `Trait`. Kinds are always composed of words where the initial letter is capitalized, and the first letter of every word is capitalized. Kinds _should_ capitalize every letter of an acronym (`HTTP`, not `Http`).

Kinds MUST be unique within a group.

### Representations of Group/Version/Kind

The fully qualified representation of Group/Version/Kind is `GROUP/VERSION.KIND`. Here are some examples:

- `local.dev/v7alpha2.Proxy`
- `cache.example.com/v1.Redis`
- `azure.com/v2.Functions`

In schematics, the group and version are presented on one field, and the kind is presented on another:

```yaml
apiVersion: local.dev/v7alpha2
kind: Proxy
```

In rare cases, it is necessary to link a group and a kind, but without specifying a version. This is done, for example, when declaring default workload types. As a general rule, this behavior should be avoided whenever necessary, but when it is necessary, this specification follows the Kubernetes pattern of construct a DNS name out of the kind and the group:

```
proxy.local.dev
Proxy.local.dev # allowed but discouraged
```

This form is not accepted as an alternative for the fully qualified version. It is only accepted in cases where it is explicitly stated by the specification that this form is accepted.


## Terminology

The following terms are used throughout this specification.

### Component Schematics
 
__Component schematics__ permit __developers__ to declare the operational characteristics of the code they deliver _in infrastructure neutral terms_. Apart from not burdening developers with infrastructural concerns, this frees operators and runtimes to meet a component's infrastructural needs in whatever opinionated manner they see fit.

A component schematic is composed of the following pieces of information:

- A Workload Type: A declaration about what kind of runtime this component relies upon. (The platform will select a runtime that is capable of running this workload type.)
- Metadata: Information _about_ the component, primarily directed toward the user
- Resource requirements: The additional minimum needs that must be satisfied in order for the component to be executed. For example, minimum memory, CPU, and filesystem mounts
- Parameters: The parameters that can be adjusted for specific runtime configuration
- Containers: A list of the runnable pieces (OCI images, functions, etc.) necessary for this component. A component has at least one of these



### Workloads and Workload Types

A hydra platform supplies a runtime (or runtimes) that can execute components. Each type of objects that can be run by the Hydra runtime is represented by a _workload type_ that describes the following:

- Metadata: Information about the workload type
- Workload Settings: Settings that an operator can provide to the workload for each component

### Traits

A trait defines a piece of add-on functionality that pertains to the operation of a component. Traits may be limited to certain workload types. They represent features of the system that are operational concerns, not developer concerns. For example, a developer may know whether or not their component can be scaled (and so choose a workload type that declares this). But an operator may decide to manually scale or to apply an autoscaler (trait) to this component.

A trait is described as:

- Metadata: Information about the trait
- Applies-to list: Enumeration of which workload types this trait applies to
- Parameters: Configuration that may be specified in an operational configuration

### Operational Configuration

An operational configuration is a resource that declares how an application (described as an application schematic and component schematics) can be instantiated and configured, including which parameter overrides and add-on traits.

An operational configuration has the following parts:

- Metadata: Information about the application instance
- Parameter Overrides: Values to supply to named parameters in the application or components
- Trait configuration: A list of traits to enable, together with parameter overrides for each trait
- Workload type settings: Overrides to workload type settings
