# 8. Practical Considerations

This section provides additional guidance on practical considerations such as security practices.

## Proposal Stages and the Maturity of the Specification

The specification is currently in Rough Draft, working toward Working Draft. After Working Draft, the specification will become a Final Specification (e.g. 1.0).

- During _Rough Draft_, no part of the specification is considered stable
- During _Working Draft_, features may be added, and issues fixed. Breaking changes may occur, but as an irregularity
- During _Final Specification_, the specification will only be updated with errata, grammatical fixes, and clearly marked "clarifying text"

Once a Final Specification is released (e.g. 1.0), a new _version_ of the spec (e.g. 1.1) may be started at the rough draft phase.

## Media Types

The media types for schematics will be defined when the specification enters Working Draft status. Preliminarily, the media types will be of the form:

- `application/oam.TYPE.v1+json`, where `TYPE` is replaced by the name of the type (e.g. `component`).

## Security

This specification, in its current form, does not mandate a specific set of security policies. However, it does provide guidance on certain aspects of security:

- OCI/Docker images MUST be referenced by SHA wherever possible
- File formats MUST be converted to a canonical format so that they can be hashed

When these two objectives are reached, systems can be constructed in which a digest verification of schematics will preserved the immutability of all of the components of the system. To wit, if a schematic references an image, and that image has a hash, then when verifying the digest of a schematic, the verification also ensures that the image reference to be pulled is the image reference used when generating the schematic.

Other security details, such as network transport security or securing data at rest, are considered beyond the scope of this specification.
