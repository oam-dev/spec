# 1. Purpose and Goals

The central problem this specification seeks to address is how cloud-oriented applications can be composed and then successfully handed off to those responsible for operating them. The problem is not so much about how to write programs, but how to take components of a service oriented (or microservice oriented) architecture, and streamline the workflow that surrounds such applications.

For example, a contemporary cloud application may be composed of dozens of microservices, each responsible for a discrete chunk of what, broadly speaking, is "an application." Such applications need to be configured, deployed, audited, updated, and deleted. Sometimes the application must be treated as a whole, and sometimes finer levels of granularity are required. And most importantly, often such applications are managed not by one person or one team, but by multiple teams who must cooperate to achieve reliability, stability, and timeliness.

This specification provides a description of such applications, where the description is aimed at separating the concerns of developers from the concerns of operators. Furthermore, it suggests patterns and processes for managing such applications. The specification describes a model for cloud native (i.e. highly distributed) cloud applications, encompassing public cloud technologies, on-prem solutions, and IoT/edge technologies. By specifying a common model, this specification provides a foundation for multiple implementations of a shared description of cloud native applications.

This open specification defines:

- __Component schematics__, which may be used by developers to declare the operational characteristics of the code they deliver _in infrastructure neutral terms_.
- __Application schematics__ based on the __Hydra__ application model for distributed, "cloud native" applications composed of such Hydra components.
- __Operational configuration__ for configuring an instance of an application.
- __Workload types and configurations__, which describe the underlying runtime for a particular workload, as well as exposing per-application configuration.
- __Traits__ for assigning operational features to instances of an application.

Additional goals of the specification are to:

- Define __roles and responsibilities__ with respect to the component and application models.
- Promote the genesis of multiple, _differentiated_ implementations of both tooling and runtimes which can operate on a common class of components and applications.

Non-goals include:

- Defining or prescribing specific development or operational workflows.
- Defining the schemas of operational resources, for example (but not limited
  to):
  - Secrets (secure, encrypted values)
  - Networks
  - Volumes
- Describing or defining the runtimes themselves

## Design Principles

The Hydra Application Model follows a few design principles that ensure the clarity, richness, and extensibility of the specification.

### Separation of Concerns

Separation of Concerns is the design philosophy in which architectural choices are made with reference to the discrete problems being solved. Divisions in artifacts like "component" and "application", or "schematics" and "configuration" are made by dividing along functional or behavioral lines. By identifying roles and responsibilities of various groups of users, the spec is divided into concepts that match the problem space.

### Platform Neutrality

Hydra is platform-agnostic. It doesn’t assume any platform-specific features. Instead, it focuses on offering a vocabulary for application developers and operators to describe desired topologies and desired behaviors independent from any specific platforms.

### Balance (Elegance)

While ensuring separation of concerns, Hydra seeks to avoid unnecessary complexity to developers who take on multiple roles in smaller teams. Simple scenarios should be achievable with minimal investment of time and energy, but complex scenarios should be accommodated without requiring re-platforming.

Hydra offers multiple abstraction layers so that operational concerns can be captured independently of developer concerns.

### Reusability

Components in the Hydra schematics are designed to be re-usable and shareable. In addition, they remain independent of the code that they describe, making it possible to re-use the code (containers), and preventing "lock-in" conditions.

The spec as a whole is designed to provide application "distributions" where the same application can be executed on different platforms without alteration. This portability of the application is intended to make the following scenarios not just possible, but easy:

- Transferring an application from a developer workstation to a production cluster or service
- Migrating from one implementation to another with no code changes
- Creating marketplace-like environments where applications can be deployed onto customer platforms

## Application Models Are Not Programming Models

There is a clear distinction between an _application model_ and a _programing model_. An application model represents an attempt to capture the characteristics of a _distributed application_ or a _cloud native application_. It does so by revealing how the constituent parts of a distributed application are sewn together to create a functional whole.

An application model describes the composition of an application and the topology of its components. It is not concerned with how each component is implemented (language, design patterns, etc).

On the other hand, a _programming model_ describes how an individual piece of software is composed. It is used by a developer to implement application components. Hydra offers an application model that does not have any requirements of a programming model.
