# 6. Traits

**Target Role: Application Operator**

A _trait_ is a discretionary runtime overlay that augments a component workload type (`workload.type`) with additional features. It represents an opportunity for those in the _application operator_ role to make specific decisions about the configuration of components, without having to involve the developer. A trait can be any configuration of a distributed application that applies to an individual component, such as traffic routing rules (e.g., load balancing policy, network ingress routing, circuit breaking, rate limiting), auto-scaling policies, upgrade strategies, and more.

The _traits system_ is defined in this specification as the way a runtime applies and manages operational behaviors to instances of components through traits.

Runtime implementations of the specification MUST provide the traits system for attaching operational behaviors to instances of components.

## Traits system rules and characteristics

Traits are applied to component instances in the [application configuration](7.application_configuration.md).

Traits SHOULD be applied into the runtime at installation/upgrade time. Traits SHOULD NOT be checked "lazily", but SHOULD be checked when the trait-holding components are created.

When more than one trait is attached to a component, it MUST:

- Apply the traits in the defined order
- Determine compatibility, and fail if the combination of traits cannot be satisfied

Traits are applied in order such that if some set of traits express dependency (e.g. ingress must be set up before SSL), this can be resolved by setting an explicit ordering.

A component instance may only have one configuration of any given trait type.

A deployment SHOULD NOT be marked complete until all trait configurations are completed. For example, if a web server component is deployed with an autoscaler trait, the web server should not be considered "running" until (a) the web server itself is running, as determined by health checks, and (b) the autoscaler trait is running, as determined by the underlying platform.

Components can specify multiple traits; therefore, a runtime MUST support the application of zero or more traits to a component. A runtime MUST produce an error and stop deployment if the requested traits cannot be fulfilled by the underlying runtime.

There is no mechanism for explicitly requiring a combination of traits. For example, a trait (`ssl`) cannot specify that it requires that another trait (`ingress`) be applied to an object. However, _implementations_ of a trait SHOULD fail if one trait cannot fulfill its contract without the presence of another trait. A system MAY support a mechanism in which a trait (`sslIngress`) is opaquely backed by two separate trait implementations (`ssl` and `ingress`).

Any trait that is made available in a runtime MUST be implemented for that runtime. For example, there cannot be a trait for `autoscaling` in a runtime with no implementation of that trait.

## Categories of traits

The traits system is designed to serve as an extension point for runtime operational capability while also providing common, and in some cases, necessary operational functionality for components.

The implementation details of a trait is beyond the scope of this document. However, to allow runtimes to implement arbitrary traits while maintaining a degree commonality for application portability across runtimes, traits are categorized in the following way:

- **Core traits.** This specification defines a set of trait definitions with type names in the `core.oam.dev` group. These traits provide operational functionality that is necessary for the operation of certain workload types and component features. Runtimes are REQUIRED to implement these traits as defined in this specification.

 - **Standard traits.** The specification defines a set of trait definitions with type names in the `standard.oam.dev` group. These traits provide operational functionality that is commonly used by application operators and implemented by most runtimes. Runtimes are RECOMMENDED to use the standard trait definitions as defined in this specification when providing equivalent operational functionality to those listed in the standard trait definitions. In other words, if a runtime is implementing trait with behavior `foo` and a standard trait definition for behavior `foo` exists, the runtime SHOULD use the standard `foo` trait definition. Application operators that intend to maximize portability of their applications should use these trait definitions when available. Although this does not _guarantee_ portability of an application, it is designed to increase portability across runtimes.

 - **Extension traits.** The specification allows a runtime to define its own set of trait definitions that are unique to that runtime in addition to those defined by core and standard traits. A runtime can choose to implement any set of traits in this category with any definition. Extension trait type names MUST NOT be in the `core.oam.dev` or `standard.oam.dev` groups.

## Trait characteristics

An individual trait MAY be tied to specific workloads (or MAY apply to all workloads). A trait MAY declare which workload it applies to.

The specification does not set requirements about how simple or complicated a trait may be. Some might expose an expansive set of configurable options while others may expose no configurable options. And it is not required that a trait be as exhaustive as its underlying technology. For example, an implementation of an autoscaling technology may provide numerous ways of determining when a component should scale. But the trait may only surface a few of those. Likewise, multiple autoscaling traits may be defined (each uniquely named), where each trait exposes a different subset of configurable options. Or one large trait may expose all of the possible autoscaling configurations.

Implementations of an OAM runtime SHOULD make all supported traits discoverable in the format explained below.

## Trait definition

This section is normative because traits are an inspectable (and possibly shareable) part of the system. All traits MUST be representable in the following format.

Traits are defined with schematics like components. As with workload definitions, each trait definition has a `definitionRef`, which is a reference to a schema that defines the configuration options for the trait.

### Top-Level Attributes

The top-level attributes of a trait define its metadata, version, kind, and spec.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `apiVersion` | `string` | Y || A string that identifies the version of the schema the object should have. The core types uses `core.oam.dev/v1alpha2` in this version of specification. |
| `kind` | `string` | Y || Must be `TraitDefinition` |
| `metadata` | [`Metadata`](2.overview_and_terminology.md#metadata) | Y | | Information about the trait. |
| `spec`| [`Spec`](#spec) | Y || A specification for trait attributes. |

### Spec

The specification defines two major things: The list of workloads to which this trait applies, and the definition reference which will define the schema of this trait.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `appliesToWorkloads` | `[]string` | N | | The list of workloads to which this trait applies. If this field is empty or unspecified or specified as `"*"`, it means _any workload_. A trait must apply to at least one workload type. This attribute must contain at least one value. |
| `definitionRef` | [`DefinitionRef`](#definitionRef) | Y | | Index of the trait definition. |

TODO: add back other fields in `TraitDefinition`; explain revision-aware trait.

#### DefinitionRef

See [*DefinitionRef*](4.workload_definitions.md#DefinitionRef).

## Core traits

The following core traits are defined in the OAM specification.

### Manual Scaler Trait

Manual scaler trait allows operators to manually scale the number of replicas for workload types.

See [*Manual Scaler*](core/traits/manual_scaler_trait.md).
