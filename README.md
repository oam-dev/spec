# Hydra Specifications

This repository holds the specifications for Hydra-compliant runtimes.

Hydra is the code name for a broad initiative to define open
specifications for an _ops-centric_ "serverless" compute platform as well as an
open source reference implementation thereof.

The Hydra Specifications project is the definitive source for the
open specifications.

*This repository is unstable.* The specification is under development, and breaking changes are made regularly.
